In this work, dynamic traveling salesman problem (DTSP) which is a NP-complete problem has been solved heuristically by employing hyper-heuristics and memory/search Algorithms. In hyper-heuristics implementation; 5 different heuristic selection strategies, i.e., simple random, random descend, random permutation, random permutation descend and choice function, have been used. After selection strategy, the heuristics are applied once or steepest descent fashion with one of 4 move acceptance criteria. These criteria, i.e., all move, only improvement, improving and equal and Monte Carlo, have been applied to determine if new solution is accepted or not. In memory/search implementation; memory and search populations and explicit memory structures have been incorporated in a population based way rather than single based solution. Hyper-heuristics with 20 test cases and memory/search algorithm results are demonstrated extensively for DTSP. In DTSPs, when the heuristic converges to a solution, a dynamic change occurs. In this type of DTSP, traffic factor is utilized for dynamic feature of the problem. In the experiments, different DTSP test cases in terms of frequency of change and severity of change have been also investigated and the best configurations of hyper-heuristics and memory/search are compared in detail.
